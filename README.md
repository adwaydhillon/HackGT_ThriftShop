Thrift Shop @ HackGT - Fall 2014

Idea
-----

Currently, students sell their items (books, furniture etc), through a Facebook group called GT Thrift Shop (https://www.facebook.com/groups/199456403537988/?ref=br_tf). This can get inefficient due to the lack of a catalog and search functionality. The aim of the new Thrift Shop is to use eBay's Finding API, along with the Milo API to create this service for Georgia Tech students.

Features
--------

- Selling functionality - Make a post on eBay (visible only to GT students (radius-search?)) through the app.
- Buying functionality - Catalog of items being sold, organized in departments. Bidding.
